**Introduction**

This project stands as a testament to hours of dedication and creativity poured into every aspect of game development. The objective was to design an engaging Space Shooter Game that not only entertains but also serves as a practical application of core OOP principles. With C++ as the foundation, we utilized the SFML library to create a visually stunning and interactive gaming experience.

**Features**

Immersive Gameplay: Engage in a fast-paced space battle, dodging obstacles and shooting down enemy spaceships.
Stunning Visuals: Experience captivating graphics and animations that add to the thrill of the game.
Player Power-Ups: Collect power-ups to enhance your spaceship's abilities and firepower.
Challenging Enemies: Face off against various types of enemy spaceships, each with unique behaviors.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your highest scores and aim for the leaderboard's top spot.

**Installation**

> Step 1 : Clone this repository to your local machine using:

 - https://github.com/Qasimhassan65/2D-Space-Shooter-Game.git

> Step 2 : Navigate to the project directory:

 - cd space-shooter

> Step 3 : Compile the game using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

- g++ -o space-shooter main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

> Step 4 : Run the compiled executable:

 - ./main

**Gameplay**
> Use the arrow keys to control your spaceship's movement.
> Press the space bar to shoot lasers and take down enemy spaceships.
> Collect power-ups to upgrade your spaceship's abilities and gain an advantage.
> Dodge incoming obstacles and enemy fire to survive and achieve a high score.

**Technical Details**

This game project demonstrates a strong grasp of OOP principles in C++. The codebase is organized into classes that represent different game elements, showcasing inheritance and polymorphism to achieve modularity and efficient code reuse. SFML's graphics capabilities are harnessed to create an engaging visual experience.
